#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

        - A function is a Javascript procedure- a set of statements that perform a task or calculate a value. To use a function,
        you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

#### 2. What is a method?

        - Methods are actions that can be performed on objects (belongs to a class). It is a property containing a function definition. 

#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?

        - charAt()      : Returns the character at the specified index (position)
        - concat()      : Joins two or more strings
        - indexOf()     : Returns the position of the first round occurence of a specified value in a string
        - lastIndexOf() : Returns the position of the last round occurence of a specified value in a string
        - includes()    : Checks whether a string contains the specified string or characters
        - toUpperCase() : Converts a string to uppercase letters
        - toLowerCase() : Converts a string to lowercase letters
        
#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?

        - Mutator methods modify the original array and accessors return a new value or representation.

        - console.log : logs out information in console
        - return      : returns execution to the caller with optional result 
        
#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most? 

        - Doing problems on the projector as a class really helps me. I'm more of a visual learner, so seeing 
          Damon or Sarah do examples is a lot more beneficial for me than trying to read instructions on my own.
